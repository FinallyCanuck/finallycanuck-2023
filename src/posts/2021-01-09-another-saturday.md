Another Saturday. A weekend day that runs into the next one. No real plans other than catching up on laundry and a top-up grocery shop before tomorrow's delivery.

I'm thankful for technology allowing me to keep in touch with friends, and for allowing me to record my thoughts here.

Not to avoid the Sunday dread before the start of the next week of work. That sounds too sad. It's more monotonous than sad for me, really.
