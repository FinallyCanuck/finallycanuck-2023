So, was this experiment a success?

On a scale of 1-10, with 10 being completely successful, I'd give this a 9. iOS has come a long way in recent years and introduces a number of convenience features I can't easily find in the Android ecosystem.

The point lost is the tightness of the Apple ecosystem. For example, if you want to use a fitness tracker or smartwatch made by someone else, compatibility takes a hit. For common measurements, such as heart rate and steps taken, there should be a common protocol to accept this information from any capable, modern device.

Prior to this experiment, I was already using Apple Music since the start of the year. The lack of Chromecast support is frustrating given Apple doesn't make a comparable series of devices for which to cast. AirPlay is not as widely adopted as Chromecast and Bluetooth doesn't offer a feature-complete solution.

Despite the complaints above, I'm planning to stick with iPhone. Will I run out and get an Apple Watch, MacBook Air or Pro, and an iPad? Not likely. (I will, however, accept them as gifts.) When my current tech is due to be replaced, I will take a harder look at these options. The irony of this is that I'm typing this post using a MacBook Air from 2014. #contradictions

If you want to follow me on any of the Apple services that have sharing features (such as Music and Fitness), let me know.
