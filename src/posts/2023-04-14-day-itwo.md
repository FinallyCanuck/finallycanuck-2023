Made the noob error and forgot that all apps no longer need to be shown on the home screens. That was a really old limitation from my previous iOS (iPhone OS) days.

I started to organise everything into folders to reduce the clutter when I stumbled upon the App Library as an alphabetical list. It's now time to change my management strategy.

I'm still having trouble navigating some apps. For example, I keep trying to swipe right on Apple Music to go back to the Explore screen. I'll get the hang of it.

Still not in iLove with the on-screen keyboard. I don't want to go third party right away because I want to given the standard one a chance.

I did break down and download the Gmail app. I just can't get into the standard Mail app. Calendar is fine.

The adventure continues...
