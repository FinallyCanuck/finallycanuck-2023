In work, as in the rest of your life, you make trade-offs.

Some trade-offs are small, such as choosing french fries over a salad. Others are bigger, such as spending the money necessary to send your child to private school vs. sending them to public school.

When you choose the fries, you indulge in the salty goodness tonight and pledge to eat more veggies tomorrow. If you break your pledge tomorrow, you've still got a chance to recover the next day. If you never recover, you'll end up in big trouble with heart disease and obesity.

Now it's time to send the kid to school. The choice here is bigger and is based on the controversial theory that private schools produce smarter (better) students. Let's accept that theory as true, just for the moment. Private school is expensive so you decide that public school will work for preschool and pledge to budget for private school starting with kindergarten. Kindergarten comes and goes as do grades one through five.

The next moment of truth is grade six (junior high or middle school or secondary school, whichever it's called in your world). This moment is no longer just about money. Your child has an opinion and she will let you know that it's the only one that matters. She wants to continue on with her friends. If you move her away from her friends and transfer her to private school now, things will be painful and rebellion is inevitable.

You could finally make what you believe is the right decision. However, it's probably too late. It may be time for a completely new plan that can still be successful.

The point I make here is this: Eat your veggies!
