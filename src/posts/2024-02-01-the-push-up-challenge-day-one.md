### Day 1: 49 push-ups

Today’s target is 49 push-ups, for the **4.9 times increased likelihood of poor mental health among those experiencing a low sense of community**.  

How connected you feel with your neighbours has a direct impact on your mental health. One study found that people with a weak sense of community were 3.2 times more likely to report poor general health outcomes, and 4.9 times more likely to report poor mental health outcomes.   

On the flip-side, research also suggests that being more integrated with people in your neighbourhood is associated with feeling happier. The same study noted that interacting more often with our neighbours is associated with an increase in subjective well being.   

Interacting more with others in your neighbourhood may lead to better well being and mental health - and being a kind and social neighbour could lead to higher life satisfaction for everyone involved. Here are some ideas for bonding with your neighbours: 

- Drop off a card with some homemade apple pie or pecan pie brownies on Thanksgiving. 
- Let them know when you’ll be out of town. Perhaps even ask them to water your plants or keep an eye on your place – and offer to do the same when they head on vacation. 
- Host a party and invite your neighbours along.
