Survived the first full work week of the year. There's that.

Looking to work on updates to this site over the weekend. The stretch goal (all goals for this are stretch goals) is to create a card for each of the posts in the post list. This would apply to the home page and the archive as they use the same template. It will be a test of my CSS skills. Hopefully I'll succeed and it won't become a hot mess. Thank goodness for version control, I say.
