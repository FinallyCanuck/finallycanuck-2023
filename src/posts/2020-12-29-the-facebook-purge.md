I stopped actively participating in Facebook's social media platform earlier this year. However, I'm now going through the arduous task of deleting my content. It's a long process, especially since I was active on the site for nearly 13 years.

I can't part ways with Facebook entirely because of the messaging ecosystem. If I stop using Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, I'd have to go back to SMS. I don't think I even know my friends mobile numbers. There are alternatives, such as Signal and Telegram, but there isn't wide adoption and I don't believe any of my friends use these.

I've clung on to Instagram as a spectator but I think my time there is about to end as well. I haven't posted in a very long time and there isn't much of a reason to keep feeding that part of the Facebook dynasty.

Now back to delete a batch, wait, delete another batch, wait...
