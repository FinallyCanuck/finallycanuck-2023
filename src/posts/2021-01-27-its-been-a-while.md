A whole week has passed since my last post. There hasn't been much to say.

When you're confined to your home all the time, experiences are limited. The biggest excitement of the week is the grocery delivery. Party time.

I look forward to being able to travel a little way away from my home. Nothing extravagant. I just want to get on a train and see a different landscape.
