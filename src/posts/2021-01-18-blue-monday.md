Change is required. Being this unhappy for too long will get me killed. I don't think that's an exaggeration.

I still crave peace and unity and cooperation. Am I a hippie? Not old enough. I can be a great contributor to my work, but my requirements for an employer and a team have increased over the years. My ability to tolerate lack of leadership and lack of teamwork have reached record lows. I care when you care is the position I appear to have taken now. I fear that's a high bar.
