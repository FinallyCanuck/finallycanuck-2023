On my last day in the office, I received Jamie Oliver's latest cookbook, "Jamie's Food Revolution" as a gift from my friends. As I promised, I am sharing my creations as I start making the recipes. The featured image is a picture from my first recipe, Perfect Roast Beef. It was very good and I'll be having left-overs for lunch today.

In my opinion, not a bad first attempt. There will be more to come.

Thank you, friends!
