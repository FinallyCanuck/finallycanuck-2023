I don't handle stress well anymore. The slightest inconvenience sets me into a near-toddler-level tantrum at times. It's disturbing.

I've been working to understand my inability to handle any amount of adversity. Part of me is looking for ultimate peace and calm, but I never seem to find it. I don't want medication to be the answer but I'm fearing more and more as this may be necessary. I've worked my way off medication in 2019 and going back feels like a failure. With the current state of the NHS, I don't think I can get time with a psychiatrist to find a solution, especially in the middle of the pandemic.

Do I take a Victorian approach and take bed rest for weeks or months to force a sense of calm? Then what?
