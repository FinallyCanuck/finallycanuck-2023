## Mindfulness
### Day 5: 50 push-ups

Today’s target is 50 push ups, for the **5 minutes per day of mindfulness that has been shown to reshape your mood**.

Taking some time from your day to practice mindfulness can have significant positive impacts on stress and anxiety levels. One study even showed that mindfulness appears to change the brain in depressed patients.

Mindfulness is a simple, yet powerful tool for improving mental well-being. Being mindful involves giving your attention to the present moment. To practice mindfulness, simply bring awareness to the thoughts, emotions and senses you notice, without judgement. You can do this by focusing on your breathing or on sensations in different parts of your body.

By pausing to observe our current physical and mental state, we can come to better understand ourselves and our emotions. When we are not ruminating on the past or worrying about the future, we can reduce distractions and calm our minds and bodies.

Mindfulness doesn’t have to involve sitting in meditation for long periods. We can practice mindfulness while doing simple everyday activities such as walking, eating, sitting on the bus or even brushing our teeth.

For example, next time you go for a walk, notice any thoughts that pop into your head, let them go, and then return your focus to the feel of your boots on your feet, and the sound they make as they crunch in the leaves or snow. Each time a new thought arises, notice it, then let it float by, and bring your attention back to another sensation, such as the feel of the cool air on your cheeks. Give it a go!
