I have been using four primary sources in my job search. Each is simply a repository.

1. [Workopolis.com](http://www.workopolis.com/): The most popular source of employment opportunities in Canada.
2. [LinkedIn Jobs](http://www.linkedin.com/jobs): This source skews to higher, senior-level opportunities or jobs that require extensive previous experience.
3. [Canada Job Bank](http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/): This is a service of Service Canada and, on first inspection, focuses on entry-level jobs and opportunities with small businesses.
4. [Monster.ca](http://www.monster.ca/): The Canadian extension of Monster.com.

As I stated in my [post](http://chancestobegreat.wordpress.com/2010/06/08/how-do-we-put-the-human-back-in-human-resources/) on Tuesday, the experience is very impersonal and it feels like I'm rummaging through a pile of crap looking for a gem with little success. I know there are executive recruiters out there; however, the challenge for me is locating them and initiating contact.

If you have any tips or tricks to improve the process, please let me know.
