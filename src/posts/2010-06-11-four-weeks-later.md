Well, it's been four weeks since I said goodbye to my friends at my previous employer. Here's a summary of what's taken place since then.

- Spent a weekend in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania and Wilmington, Delaware visiting friends.
- Spent a week in the World of a famous MouseÂ®/MD.
- Submitted dozens of job applications.
- Explored continuing education options, mainly the benefits of certification.
- Got engaged.
- **Launched this blog!**

I'd say that's a pretty full list and there's only more to come. Stay tuned.
