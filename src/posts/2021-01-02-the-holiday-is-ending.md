The Sunday night dread is regularity for me. It's Saturday afternoon and this week's dread is already starting to appear.

I find this dread odd, actually. I don't have a demanding job as such, but it's not satisfying for me. When I think deeply about it, what comes to mind is that I don't feel part of a team. There isn't a visible passion for the work we do. People are just working.

I am most productive and motivated when I'm around people who are genuinely interested in their work. This isn't the case in my current situation.

Does this make me a snowflake and do I just need to suck it up and deal? If not, where do I go from here? If I move on, I don't know where to even look. The things that I value don't show up in job descriptions. More thought is required.
