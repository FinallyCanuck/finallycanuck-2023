A benefit of working through the Christmas period is that I don't have a mountain of catch-up to do. My inbox is clear whilst my colleagues are digging out from under a mountain.

My meetings have been shorter than scheduled and I can ease into what will likely become a busy time.

Short and sweet this time.
