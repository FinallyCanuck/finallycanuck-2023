Mental health issues are very important to me. In February (that starts tomorrow!), I will be doing 2,000 push-up (press-up) in support of the Canadian Mental Health Association.

Visit my donor page at https://www.thepushupchallenge.ca/fundraiser/peterrandazzo/the-push-up-challenge to donate or cheer me on.
