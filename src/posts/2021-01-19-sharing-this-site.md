I took a step forward last night. I published the URL to this site on my Twitter profile. I didn't write a post about it or tell anyone, but this is a little further out of the closet (so to speak).

I write this for myself, but I guess I'm also a bit of an exhibitionist. Will this change how I write? I don't think so, but who really knows. I've not written anything I regret thus far. Will this change make what I write more interesting? Not likely.

Stay tuned. Or not. That's on you.
