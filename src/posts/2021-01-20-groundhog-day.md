So, I pay a counsellor every week to talk about the same thing. I discuss what's bothering me. We attribute the thing to childhood trauma. I pay him £42. I've been doing this for nearly four years now. I'm unsure if any progress is being made.

Awareness of my issues isn't what I need. I'm well aware. I'm looking for solutions or at least coping mechanisms. I know he can't provide that. Since he can't provide that, should I stop investing?

Sometimes I feel better after my session, but many times I don't. What's the benefit? There's a lot I can do with £168 a month. At the very least I could give it to charity so it helps someone else as I may simply be a lost cause.
