With all the talk of the return of long form blogging, it makes sense to make a post. I won't dare to recap my life since my last blog post.

The first two months of 2023 are already gone. My mind is now focused on getting ready for the big move back to Canada this summer. Slowly selling off stuff that can't or is not worth moving is therpeutic. It plays nicely with my minimalistic tendencies. Also not waiting to the last minute will reduce the amount of chaos in the lead up to the one-way flight.

Anyone have a need for an assortment of coffee making appliances?
