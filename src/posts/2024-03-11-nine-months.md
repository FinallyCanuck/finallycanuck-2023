It's been nine months and there's no baby to show for it.

The job market here in the Greater Toronto Area isn't in a good place right now. I know this will improve, as it always does. I just need to hold my nerve. I plan for rainy days like this but my self-esteem takes a hit with each automated "thanks, but no thanks" email message for a corporate recruiting platform. 

I've debated looking to volunteer but I'm unsure in what capacity. Queer charities look for young volunteers with happy puppy energy and that's just not me. I'll keep looking.

On the paid employment front, is it time for OnlyFansâ„¢? Probably not. When I stop looking so hard, that's when an opportunity will surface.
