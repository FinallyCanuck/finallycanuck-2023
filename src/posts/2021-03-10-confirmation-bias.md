I've been doing a considerable amount a research into the behaviours and traits that are exhibited in people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The more I research, the more I form an opinion that a formal diagnosis is something I should pursue.

I'm not researching alone. I'm speaking with my counsellor. Whilst he doesn't specialise in this, he provides an objective perspective on the matter.

Getting a diagnosis as an adult can be challenging as many people associate ASD with children. The first path to requesting a diagnosis is via a GP. Given the stresses on the NHS caused by the pandemic, this is likely not a good time to add this concern to their workload. However, this doesn't stop my research and the identification of coping mechanisms to help manage the behaviours.

Let the adventure continue, I guess.
