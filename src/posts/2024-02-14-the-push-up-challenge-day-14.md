Some progress has been made but I've also been fighting a cold. This has been more of a challenge than I anticipated, but that's okay. Nothing like a heavy topic this Valentine's Day.

## Suicide
### Day 14: 118 push-ups

Today’s target is 118 push-ups, for the **11.8% of Canadians who have contemplated suicide in their lifetime**.

In Canada, around 12 lives are lost to suicide daily. And in total, approximately 4,500 lives are lost to suicide in Canada each year. In 2020, 23,300 Canadians were hospitalized or died by intentionally harming themselves.The impact reverberates across age, gender, and background. Suicide rates are about three times higher among men than women. For Canadian youth and young adults aged 15 to 34, it’s the second leading cause of death.

This is a staggering reality that touches lives, families, and our communities. Research shows that after a death by suicide, many people grapple with its shadow. For each life lost to suicide, the World Health Organization estimates that 10 people are deeply affected. Beyond these people, up to 120 additional people will also be affected by the death.

Behind the statistics lie stories of pain and strength, a struggle that demands our compassion and action. And within this darkness, there’s an opportunity to shine light. Behind a smile, there may be silent struggles. Reaching out, even when it’s uncomfortable, might make all the difference. Sometimes, knowing someone cares is the lifeline that someone in distress needs.

If you’re struggling with suicidal thoughts, remember that help is available. Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. You don’t have to face your struggles alone and your presence matters.
