In an environment where professionals have varying degrees of education and experience, it can be difficult for an employer to know what they are getting when they choose a new employee. To solve for this, many professionals obtain certification in one or more aspects of their field. Is this the answer to standardizing skills?

In my case, I have a number of options based on my experience and areas of interest. Here are just some of them.

- [Certified Credit Professional](http://www.creditedu.org/COURSES/description.htm): The official designation granted to professionals in the Canadian credit management field by the Credit Institute of Canada (CIC).
- [Salesforce.com Certified Administrator](http://www.salesforce.com/services-training/training_certification/certification/): Certifies the knowledge of Salesforce CRM and the Force.com platform.
- [Certified HTML Developer](http://www.w3schools.com/cert/cert_html.asp): Proves fundamental knowledge of web development using HTML, XHTML, and CSS.

What I need to ask myself is this. Is this a valuable investment or is it all [hokum](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hokum)?

What's your take on certification?
