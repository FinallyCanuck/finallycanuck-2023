So, it's the weekend. Woohoo!? No work to think about for two days so that's not terrible.

What am I thinking about? I'm thinking about life being on pause at the moment, as it is for most people. It's tiring not doing very much physically. I can't walk around the neighbourhood anymore. I've seen everything there possibly is at this point. If the weather were nicer, then maybe it would be okay. It's January. I can only ask for so much.

Travel will come again. I would like to pandemic statistics improve so I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, as they say. Right now, I think we're spinning our collective wheels hoping to get a grip. It's hard.

I keep thinking about what a better job would be for me. Looking at job listing is problematic when you don't know which direction to look. Would an incremental change be right or someone wildly different? If wildly different, then what?
