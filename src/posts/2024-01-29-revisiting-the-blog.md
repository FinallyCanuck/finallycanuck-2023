I'm putting a little effort into this blog again. No promises on the frequency of the posts.

I've upgraded the CMS so I can post via a tablet (previously I had to use a desktop or laptop with a keyboard). I've also resolved the RSS feed so there's that as well.

Let's see if I have post more than once a year. That's a good start, right?
